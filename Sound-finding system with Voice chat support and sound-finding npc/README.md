A easy to use sound-finding module which also detects noise from voice chat! There is an example monster/npc in the file, as the npc is an example, it doesn't follow/damage the player, it only goes to where a sound is made.

Features of the module:
1. Play sounds [Required to play from module to detect it]
2. Detect sound position after it is played
3. Initiate player voice detection [Must be ran for the module to detect player voice detection]

There is also a simple monster handler which allows you to create a monster/npc at any position (Vector3) and make it pathfind to any position with some changeable settings (you can see the settings inside the example monster script). It also allows you to stop the monster if its pathfinding to a position and destroy it whenever required!
